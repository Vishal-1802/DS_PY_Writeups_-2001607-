        "\n",
        "-Uncertainty refers to a lack of knowledge, predictability, or certainty about a particular event, outcome, or situation. It is a state of not being able to accurately determine or predict what will happen in the future or what the true state of something is. Uncertainty can arise from various sources, including incomplete information, complex systems, randomness, and ambiguity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Uncertainty is a common aspect of many fields, including science, economics, finance, decision-making, and everyday life. In science, for example, there may be uncertainty about the results of an experiment due to measurement errors or the inherent variability of natural processes. In economics and finance, uncertainty can influence investment decisions and financial markets when future economic conditions are uncertain. In decision-making, individuals or organizations may have to make choices with incomplete information, leading to uncertain outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In statistics and probability theory, uncertainty is often quantified using measures like probability distributions, confidence intervals, and standard deviations. These measures provide a way to describe the range of possible outcomes and their likelihood based on available information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dealing with uncertainty is a fundamental challenge for individuals and societies alike. Strategies to cope with uncertainty often involve risk analysis, contingency planning, scenario analysis, and adaptive approaches to adjust to changing circumstances. Embracing uncertainty can also lead to openness to new possibilities and a willingness to learn and adapt in the face of unpredictable situations.\n",

In other words, the value of variable A influences the probability distribution of variable B.\n",
